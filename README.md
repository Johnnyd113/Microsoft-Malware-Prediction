Below you can find a outline of how to reproduce my 4th place solution for the Microsoft Malware Prediction Challenge competition.


#ARCHIVE CONTENTS


#HARDWARE: (The following specs were used to create the original solution)
1. AWS c4.8xlarge (36 vCPUs, 60 GB memory)
2. Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (100 GB boot disk) 

#SOFTWARE (python packages are detailed separately in `requirements.txt`):
Python 3.7.1

# DATA SETUP 
(assumes the [Kaggle API](https://github.com/Kaggle/kaggle-api) is installed)


```
mkdir raw_data
cd raw_data
kaggle competitions download -c microsoft-malware-prediction
unzip test.csv.zip
unzip train.csv.zip
```

The next line will read in the train and test csv files from the RAW_DATA_DIR defined in SETTINGS.json.
It will save a pickled version of the processed trian and test files in CLEAN_DATA_DIR

`python prepare_data.py`

# MODEL BUILD: There are three options to produce the solution.
