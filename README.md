Below you can find a outline of how to reproduce my 4th place solution for the Microsoft Malware Prediction Challenge competition.


#ARCHIVE CONTENTS
Directories:
data/ - The original train and test csv files from the competition, along with another folder for the processed data
models/ - The 5 LightGBM models that were used to produce the submission
logs/ the training logs for the models




#HARDWARE: (The following specs were used to create the original solution)
1. AWS c4.8xlarge (36 vCPUs, 60 GB memory)
2. Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (100 GB boot disk) 

#SOFTWARE (python packages are detailed separately in `requirements.txt`):
Python 3.7.1

# DATA SETUP 
The data folder should contain the original train and test csv files from the competition.
The clean folder within the data folder already contains the processed train and test data files.
The next line will read in the train and test csv files from the RAW_DATA_DIR defined in SETTINGS.json.
It will save a pickled version of the processed trian and test files in CLEAN_DATA_DIR

`python prepare_data.py`
-The processed data already exists within the clean folder within the data folder
-Running this line will overwrite the already processed data.



# MODEL BUILD: There are three options to produce the solution.

`python train.py`
This will retrain the models used for submission and save them in the models directory. The pretrained models already exist in the directory. This takes about 9 hours to train.

`python predict.py`
This will generate another submission csv file for the competition and save it in the submission directory. The competition submission csv is already in the directory and running this function will overwrite that file. This takes about 15 minutes to run
