# Microsoft-Malware-Prediction
4th Place Submission to Kaggle's Microsoft Malware Prediction Challenge

Hello!

Below you can find a outline of how to reproduce my solution for the Microsoft Malware Prediction Challenge competition.


#ARCHIVE CONTENTS


#HARDWARE: (The following specs were used to create the original solution)
Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (100 GB boot disk)
AWS c4.8xlarge (36 vCPUs, 60 GB memory)

#SOFTWARE (python packages are detailed separately in `requirements.txt`):
Python 3.7.1

#DATA SETUP (assumes the [Kaggle API](https://github.com/Kaggle/kaggle-api) is installed)
# below are the shell commands used in each step, as run from the top level directory

mkdir raw_data
cd raw_data

'kaggle competitions download -c microsoft-malware-prediction'

unzip test.csv.zip

unzip train.csv.zip


# DATA PROCESSING
This will read in the train and test csv files from the RAW_DATA_DIR defined in SETTINGS.json.
It will save a pickled version of the processed trian and test files in CLEAN_DATA_DIR

python prepare_data.py

# MODEL BUILD: There are three options to produce the solution.
1) very fast prediction
    a) runs in a few minutes
    b) uses precomputed neural network predictions
2) ordinary prediction
    a) expect this to run for 1-2 days
    b) uses binary model files
3) retrain models
    a) expect this to run about a week
    b) trains all models from scratch
    c) follow this with (2) to produce entire solution from scratch

shell command to run each build is below
#1) very fast prediction (overwrites comp_preds/sub1.csv and comp_preds/sub2.csv)
python ./predict_code/calibrate_model.py

#2) ordinary prediction (overwrites predictions in comp_preds directory)
sh ./predict_code/predict_models.sh

#3) retrain models (overwrites models in comp_model directory)
sh ./train_code/train_models.sh
